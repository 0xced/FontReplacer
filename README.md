## About

**FontReplacer** has been discontinued. If you want to work with custom fonts directly in Interface Builder, I suggest you to use [MoarFonts](http://pitaya.ch/moarfonts/) which is much better since:

1. It works on iOS 7
2. It’s WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)
3. It doesn’t use any private API
4. It has zero overhead as it doesn’t use any runtime hackery
